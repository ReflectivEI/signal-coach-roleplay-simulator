CAPABILITY EVALUATION RULES (deterministic — apply strictly using canonical metric names):

1. question_quality — Metric: Question Quality (Signal Awareness)
   effective: questions reflect current HCP context and move conversation toward decision/clarification/next step
   developing: questions have some value but are generic, closed, or not fully targeted to HCP's stated context
   missed: questions are absent, leading, redundant, or fail to advance understanding in any direction

2. listening_responsiveness — Metric: Listening & Responsiveness (Signal Interpretation)
   effective: rep correctly interprets what HCP communicated AND responds in a way that clearly reflects that understanding
   developing: interpretation is partial or response is only loosely aligned with what HCP actually said
   missed: rep misinterprets, ignores, or talks past HCP's actual input — response does not reflect what was communicated

3. customer_engagement_signals — Metric: Customer Engagement Cues (Customer Engagement Monitoring)
   effective: rep notices shifts in HCP participation and conversational momentum and adjusts accordingly
   developing: rep partially notices engagement shifts but does not consistently adjust
   missed: rep continues without adjustment despite observable changes in HCP participation or momentum

4. making_it_matter — Metric: Value Framing (Value Connection)
   effective: rep connects information to HCP's stated priorities AND translates into clear customer outcomes
   developing: rep attempts relevance but stays abstract or incomplete — does not clearly articulate outcome implication
   missed: rep stays generic, product-led, or disconnected from HCP's real-world context — no explicit relevance established

5. objection_navigation — Metric: Objection Handling (Objection Navigation)
   effective: rep maintains composure AND explores objection before responding — sustaining productive dialogue
   developing: rep acknowledges objection but moves too quickly to justification or resolution
   missed: rep becomes defensive, dismissive, or fails to engage the underlying concern constructively

6. conversation_control_structure — Metric: Conversation Control & Structure (Conversation Management)
   effective: rep provides clear directional intent and adjusts structure appropriately as conversation evolves
   developing: structure exists but is inconsistent, uneven, or insufficiently adaptive to new input
   missed: conversation drifts without recovery, becomes rep-dominated, or loses coherent purpose

7. adaptability — Metric: Adaptability (Adaptive Response)
   effective: rep recognizes changes in interaction AND makes timely, appropriate adjustments to approach
   developing: some adjustment occurs but is either insufficiently responsive or not well-calibrated to situation
   missed: rep repeats same approach despite observable changes in conditions, constraints, or HCP direction

8. commitment_gaining — Metric: Commitment Gaining (Commitment Generation)
   effective: rep establishes specific, concrete next action that HCP voluntarily owns
   developing: rep hints at or suggests next steps but does not clearly secure customer ownership
   missed: no meaningful next-step attempt — conversation ends without clarity or customer commitment

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Reflect the predicted HCP state — your tone and body language MUST align with predictedBehaviorState and predicted engagement
2. If volatility = slightly_disrupted or disrupted, shorten responses and increase sharpness
3. Classify rep's observable behavior (question_type, response_alignment, etc.)
4. Generate natural HCP reply with ONE aligned context-aware cue (physical/behavioral signal that matches the HCP's emotional/cognitive state and response)
5. Cue MUST be a single observable signal (e.g., "glances at watch", "leans forward", "nods slowly", "crosses arms")
6. Cue MUST logically connect to what the HCP is saying and their internal state
